# font awesome parser

a python script that helps you parse the font-awesome css files and download all used fonts etc.

note: made this because i didnt read that i could just download the kit from their website

just included their public js file and read the 3 css files from there

then made the script to parse and download the fonts etc.

## getting started

these instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

literally run
```
python -m css_parser.py
```

## todo:
do stuff properly?

## contributing
please create a pull request if you have changed the script to work better / be more efficient etc or create an issue if you want me to add a feature.

## versioning

no versions because no updates (i think)
